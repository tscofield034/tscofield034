<h1>Hi, I'm Trey!</h1>

*I am a Data Scientist skilled in Python, SQL, and machine learning applications. I have experience using statistics and various data analytic methods to create powerful visualizations, models, and software deployments in the industry sector. 

Having previously studied mathematics, signal processing, and machine learning, I have been exposed to a wide variety of knowledge and bring a lot to the table for companies seeking data-driven solutions. I have led research for NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory in machine learning projects seeking high recall rates in class-imbalanced, remote sensing applications. I also have experience as a software engineer on a small team at a military defense company where I helped design and test algorithms for various signal-processing tasks in a high data-rate system.

In my free time, I enjoy alpine skiing, mountain biking, being on the lake, and backpacking with my dog Willa. 

Please feel free to connect with me as I would love to gain more perspective from people already in the field or about any new opportunities!
